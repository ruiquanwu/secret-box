    %h4.about-description
      %p
        The idea of building this site comes from my own experience for making photo album. There is no easy way to make an old-fashioned photo album in current market. You have to order an album, and print out photos, and then place photos to your album.
      %p Wouldn't be nice if you can order an album and print out the photos and assemble them all in one place? With that you can focus on selecting the photos and place them nicely in the album.

    %h2 Why secret?
    .well
